I have developed an innovative machine learning project designed to classify incoming emails as either 'spam' or 'ham' (non-spam). The project leverages logistic regression,
a robust statistical method that is particularly effective for binary classification tasks. By analyzing and extracting key features from email content,
such as the frequency of certain keywords, the presence of links, or unusual formatting, the model can predict the likelihood of an email being spam with considerable accuracy.

The core of the system involves preprocessing email data through techniques like tokenization, stemming, and vectorization to transform textual information into structured numerical data.
This processed data is then fed into a logistic regression model, which has been trained on a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails. The model learns patterns and correlations during training,
enabling it to generalize and accurately classify unseen emails.


This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems like spam detection, 
improving email management and safeguarding users from potentially harmful or unwanted content.
It highlights the effectiveness of logistic regression as a simple yet powerful tool for tackling classification challenges
